# modern-tenant-portal

A tenant portal website with a clean and modern design. The color scheme is a combination of blue for the sidebar and grey for the main content area. The sidebar includes navigation items such as 'My Page', 'Agreements', 'Rent Notices', 'Offers', 'Error Reports', 'Mailings', 'Laundry Booking', 'Queues', and 'Documents', each with an accompanying icon. The main area features sections for a customizable logo and landlord name, a welcome message, unpaid rent notices, and the latest mailings and error reports. Users should be able to click to open messages or reports. The layout is structured with clear divisions between different sections, using both boxes and whitespace effectively. The design should be responsive, providing a similar experience on the mobile view, which showcases a condensed menu with icons.
